# Types of Policies

### Organizational Policies

These policies focus on matters that relate to all aspects of an organization. They are umbrella policies that encapsulate the business as a whole.

### System-wide Policies

These policies focus on specific computers or network systems as well as the necessary security controls that protect them.

### Issue-specific Policies

These policies focus only on specific organizational issues such as department issues, business products and processes, and others. They are not concerned with the overall organization, nor do they target specific computer and network systems.
