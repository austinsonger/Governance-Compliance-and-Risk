# Does your organization have a formal policy on the use of mobile devices?

## What

A mobile device policy establishes rules on how an organization manages mobile devices. Mobile devices are a particular area of risk as they regularly leave most businesses physical as well as network perimeter.&#x20;

Measures must be taken to ensure the security of such devices when they are connected to other networks (anything from a home network or the guest WiFi in a coffee shop) as well as from physical loss or theft, all which could result in the loss of client data.&#x20;



## Why

Processing sensitive information on behalf of a client or being granted access to their network to perform any function, even if not specifically processing data, can add a significant amount of risk to the client who may suffer data loss or another form of damaging data breach if a supplier did not take due care in protecting its mobile devices.
