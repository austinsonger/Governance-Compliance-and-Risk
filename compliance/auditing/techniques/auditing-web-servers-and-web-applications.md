# Auditing Web Servers and  Web Applications

## Web Servers



### Verify that the web server is running on a dedicated logical system not shared with other critical applications.

**HOW**



### Verify that the web server is fully patched and updated with the latest approved code.

**HOW**

**HOW**



### Verify that only appropriate protocols and ports are allowed to access the web server.

**HOW**



### Verify that accounts allowing access to the web server are managed appropriately and use strong passwords.

**HOW**



### Ensure that appropriate controls exist for files, directories, and virtual directories.

**HOW**



### Ensure that unnecessary information such as version and directory listings are not exposed through the web interface.

**HOW**



### Ensure that the web server has appropriate logging enabled and that monitoring processes are in place.

**HOW**



### Ensure that script extensions are mapped appropriately.

**HOW**



### Verify the validity of any server certificates in use.

**HOW**



## Web Applications

### Ensure that the web application is protected against injection attacks.

**HOW**



### Review the application for authentication and session management vulnerabilities.

**HOW**

**HOW**



### Verify that proper access controls are enforced.

**HOW**



### Review controls surrounding maintaining a secure configuration.

**HOW**



### Review the website for cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities.

**HOW**



### Review protections against exploitation of deserialization sequences.

**HOW**



### Review processes to ensure vulnerabilities are not present in libraries, frameworks, or other components.

**HOW**



### Ensure that adequate logging is present and review processes for examining log data.

**HOW**



### Review the security training provided to application development teams and ensure that development teams understand secure coding practices.

**HOW**



### Verify that all input is validated prior to use by the web server.

**HOW**



### Evaluate the use of proper error handling.

**HOW**



### Review web application redirects and forwards to verify that only valid URLs are accessible.

**HOW**
